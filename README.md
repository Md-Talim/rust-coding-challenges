# Coding Challenges (Rust)

Learning Rust by solving challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/).
Each challenge is solved in Rust and placed in its own folder.

## Challenges

### [Word Count (`wc`)](./wc)

A simplified implementation of the Unix `wc` command.
The challenge involves building a tool that can count bytes, words, and lines in a file, step by step.
